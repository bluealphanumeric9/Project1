Creating and assessing a simple list using numpy package in Python. 

import numpy as np

cupcakes = np.array([2, 0.75, 2, 1, 0.5])
recipes = np.genfromtxt('recipes.csv',
                        delimiter=',')
#Create a NumPy array that represents this data. Each element should be a number                          
print(recipes)
#Each row represents a different recipe. Each column represents a different ingredient.
eggs=recipes[:,2]
#Select all elements from the 3rd column and save them to the variable eggs.


one_egg = recipes[(eggs == 1)]
#Which recipes require exactly 1 egg? Use a logical statement to get True or False for each value of eggs.
cupcakes = recipes[0,:]
#Create a variable for cookies with the data from the 3rd row.
print(cupcakes)
double_batch = cupcakes*2
# Get the number of ingredients for a double batch of cupcakes by using multiplication on cupcakes.
grocery_list = double_batch + cookies
#Create a new variable called grocery_list by adding cookies and double_batch.


Comments:
Note that creating an array with numpy interprets addition as "pasting two objects together" and not as an addition.
